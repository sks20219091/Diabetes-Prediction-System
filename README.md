# Diabetes-Prediction-System

## Objective

Original dataset    :  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes

Kaggle Competitions :  https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

## Overview
-Made a website for diabetes prediction for a random patient with the help of different attributes or
parameter (such as BMI,Glucose,BP,etc) for detecting whether the person is having diabetes or not.
- Extracted the data from given dataset on Kaggle by National Institute of Diabetes.
- Implemented using Logistic Regression, analysed their performances during the project and developed a
locally hosted python based web app for the purpose of prediction for a given patient.
- Implemented the project using Python libraries and framework such as Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn and
deployed using Django.itage.
